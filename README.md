# RVC Infer  

RVC-Infer is a streamlined inference tool for **Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC)** models. This repository simplifies the process of deploying and running RVC models for real-time or batch voice conversion.  

## Features  
- Efficient inference for RVC voice conversion models.  
- Support for high-quality audio outputs.  
- Simple, customizable configuration.  
- Support RVC V1 and V2 models.



## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheNeodev/RVC-Infer.git
   cd RVC-Infer
   ```  

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  


## Model Preparation  
Ensure you have a compatible pre-trained RVC model. Follow the RVC community guidelines to train or obtain models for your use.
